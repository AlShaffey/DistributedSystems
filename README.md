Q/realistic-A bout distributed systems

## What is meant by "Distributed Systems"? 

### Chat GPT answer

Distributed systems are a collection of independent computers that appear to the users of the system as a single coherent system. These systems are designed to share resources and data among multiple machines to achieve common goals, improve performance, reliability, scalability, and flexibility.

### Realistic answer

Given the the theoritical answer, all of the systems that we are working on are distibuted, specially considering the 1st two distributed system types below:
- _Client Server_
- _N-Tier_
- Peer-To-Peer **(P2P)**
- Service-Oriented Architecture **(SOA)**
- Microservices
- Micro-Frontends

**_Conventionally_**, we refer to the 1st two types as monotlithic systems, while they are actually distributed!
